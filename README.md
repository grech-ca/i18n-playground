# üåç i18n Playground

A tool for instant debugging various internationalization formats.

## Description

i18n Playground is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the debugging of internationalization formats. It provides developers with an intuitive interface to instantly visualize and test various internationalization formats, ensuring seamless localization of web applications.

Currently, i18n Playground supports the "messageformat" format, allowing developers to debug and validate their messageformat templates. However, we have plans to expand its capabilities to include support for other popular internationalization formats such as "fluent," "shopify format," and "polyglot."
